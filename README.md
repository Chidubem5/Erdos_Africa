I have decided to pursue a project titled “Implied Volatility vs. Realized Volatility for an Africa-Exposure ETF, with a West Africa Regime Overlay.”

As a Nigerian-American, I have a personal interest in understanding African financial markets—particularly those in West Africa, where local economic factors often differ significantly from continental trends.

This project will focus on volatility modeling and forecasting using real market data. The “West Africa Regime” component refers specifically to periods of heightened Nigerian Naira (NGN) volatility, which will be used as a proxy for broader West African macroeconomic uncertainty.
